README
======

j.sh maintains a jump-list of directories you actually use.  Old
directories eventually fall off the list.  It was inspired by
http://wiki.github.com/joelthelion/autojump and something similar, but
I could never get the dir list right.

INSTALL
-------
  Source into .bashrc under your '[-z "$PS1" ] || return' line.
  Then cd around for a while.

USAGE
-----
  j [--l] [regex1 ... regexn]
    regex1 ... regexn jump to the most used directory matching all masks
    --l               show the list instead of jumping
                      with no args, returns full list

Editor Integration
------------------

* Emacs

The file j.el provides code to integrate the jump-list of directories
with emacs.

* vi

No such code available.  Happy to accept patches though.

CREDITS
